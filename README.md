# TypeScript:
It is superset to Javascript. This is not a Javascript library. It just extends the core Javascript principles. It adds static typing to Javascript. Javascript is dynamically typed.

To use TypeScript, use the following commands.
- **npm init -y**
- **npm i typescript**

Typescript does not run in the browser, it compiles then converts to Javascript. To run the TypeScript compiler, run the following command.
- **npx tsc**
If you did not configure the project, you have to direct the compiler to a file.
- **npx tsc with-typescript.ts**
This command will compile the TypeScript file and convert it into a Javascript file so it can be used in the browser by your project.
